# google_books_cli
Command Line Interface that interacts with Google books API

How to run:
________________________________________
1. python make_library.py  or python sample_requests

To Note:
________________________________________
1.I was unable to complete user-defined function calls, therefore the program groups and sorts the library data at once.

2. make_library.py is unable to group and sort all books from the library, just the first  book from each subject the user inputs. However, sample_requsts.py is able to print and sort/group all books, but only form one subject. I had trouble/ ran out of time to fully merge and integrate from both programs.

3. make_library's recursive call to add more than 120 books does not work and therefore only has a maximum and minimum of 120 books to be placed in the library.

4. make_library.py and sample_requests.py can both save and load libraries but not have been called to, due to imcomplete requirements.
